# Memes to discuss public health topics

#HSS 9/16/22

### Initial notes:

Typology of characters: Victims, Persecutors, Heroes/Fools

**Methodology**

1.  What are the broader political stories that the “par-
    tial” stories embedded within coronavirus memes  
    refer to?
2.  Who are the roles of Victim, Persecutor, Hero, and  
    Fool attributed to most often?
3.  What are the main scenarios or storylines emerging  
    from the meme corpus as reflected in the most fre-
    quent associations between Victims, Persecutors,
    Heroes, and Fools?
