# Chapter 7: Identity

#### Constructivism

Constituting using social practice

Identity is unstable. <br/>

**Identity can be temporary**

Some memes will not be assosciated with something. (Identity can be temporary)
Structuration thus applies to construction of identity overtime.

**How do genders perform on the internet?**

e.g. When a women use voice chat in games they usually get harrassed.

### Affective Resonance

Your _affects_ resonates. When you understand or feel that you are a part of something.
When you identity to something.

**Identity is subject to structuration**

# Chapter 8: Memes as art

Frequently the information is accurate, but the _meme-ing_ and the delivery makes it a meme.

Some art or art forms are more focused on social commentary. (e.g. Mona lisa LH00Q by Duchamp).

### The Readymade

Taking something that already made and using those with remix and using those with discursive power on discursive community.
