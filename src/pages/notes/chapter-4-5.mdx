## Chapter 4: Political Memes

Conflict through dialogue

Politics is not the thing that happens, but done on purpose.

### Technological Affordance

- All of the things that you have access to—technology wise.
- The technology **affords** the action. It let us do stuff.

### Memetics of marginalized groups

E.g. Autism speaks

### The Imagined Audience

- You never know your audience might be.

### Fraction of Selection

- reward over effort
- Their rewards should be proportionate to their effort.
- For memes, you have an imagined audience, and imagined gratification.
- If you have the effort to have technological affordance is higher, the reward is bigger, but less successful.

### Hyperreal

- _Hyper_ - Above,
- Sits above _real_.
- E.g. Alec Baldwin’s impersonation of Trump.
- A construct of what sits on top of what is real.

### Simulacra

- e.g. LOTR, HP

### Dominant/Negotiated/Oppositional Decoding

**Dominant**
&rarr; When you look at a meme, you understand which groups have the most power over that meme, or ascribed over that meaning. Or this is the most prevalent meaning over the meme

**Oppositional Decoding**
&rarr; Oppositional meme opposes the dominant meme, then takes over and becomes the new dominant meme.

**Negotiated Decoding** (pg. 102-103)

- It is where there’s a disagreement in interpreting/reading a meme
- If there’s a disagreement in reading a meme It means that there is an ascribed ambiguity
- The meaning is something we ascribed tot he meme.

### Media Narrative

### Self-Writing

- Shape, criticize, Media Narrative
