# Chapter 3

#HSS 9/21/22

## Enthymeme

- Does not present all ? **premises** the ‘hearer/audience’ supplies it.
- Can contain assumptions about a premise and assumes audience will supply the space.

**Discursive power in the digital culture:** the agency to constitute and reconstitute social relations in online spaces.

**Digital culture:** the interaction between human and computer (mutually structuring, complex). Distinct from ‘participatory culture’ to make clear that we are factoring in the technological and economic access and power that structures online interactions (material conditions).

-> Constraints can limit the discursive power of memes.
-> Take note of barriers such as access to internet, technology, language (English, Chinese, or etc.)
-> These underlying conditions hugely affects the underlying interaction between human and computer

**Memory traces:** structural; patterns that assist in the generation and performance of acts based on expected social interactions in a social system (see structuration)

-> Makes easier for someone to participate in the community because a _material_ is readily/easily available to you.

**Ideology and discourse:** the world of social relations. ‘They do now know what they are doing, but they do it anyway.’ Collection social understanding & practice. Myths in the Barthes sense.

-> Every ideology creates a subject

## Ideology: Althusser

The only way we can recognize ourselves is with ideology. Without it, we’ll be doing things without any basis.

We acquire ideas/versions ourselves by reflecting with a ideology and practice those ideologies.

Hailing something about who you are, you construct an ideological structure around that ideology.

## Ideology: Zizek

WE DON’T INTERACT WITH THE IDEOLOGY WORLD, BUT WITH OUR MODEL OF THE WORLD, AND THE MODEL IS IDEOLOGY.

IDEOLOGY IS CONSTRUCTED THROUGH TEXT. THROUGH THINGS YOU READ THAT REAFFIRMS THAT STRUCTURE OF THE WORLD;

He focuses in the maintenance of roles.
Ex. Pokemon Go. -> You’re interacting with something

It’s an imagined world, because there’s no based reality. You only have a purpose in that _realm_ of certain ideology.

The ultimate purpose of ideology, for Zizek, is to support capitalism because we live in it.

::Semiotics: Study of signs::

## Semiotics: Umberto Eco

**Communication follows this framework:**
Meaning (intended) -> Communication (encoded) -> Interpretant (interpreted)

## Intertextuality: Kristen

All text is intertexts: they draw meaning from relationships to all other texts.
