Thesis: Do YouTube videos that generate a high volume of derivatives (remix) share common features? And, if so, what are they?

Memetic videos: Common Features

- ordinary people,
- flawed masculinity,
- humor,
- simplicity -> makes It easier to imitate.,
- repetitiveness, and
- whimsical content -> most of the things that we see in these videos does not affect anything in the ‘real world’.

### Illocution can be, per Searle

-> Representative, or assertive,

Structuration (Duality of Structure)
-> Behavior of the agents in the system.
